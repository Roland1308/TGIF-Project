                <p class="card card-body">
                    In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and
                    susceptible to public opinion dates back at least to the time of the
                    Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on absolutist doctrine of
                    state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal
                    legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden,
                    for example, (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory)
                    enacting free press legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of the
                    Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is
                    strongly related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public
                    sphere.

                <p class="card card-body">
                    Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and
                    France (1789), freedom of the press enshrined provisions and requirements for
                    public budgetary accounting and freedom of the press in constitutional articles.
                    In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on
                    these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal
                    politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.

                    Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic

                    legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted the first freedom of
                    information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the
                    eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after
                    gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents
                    in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).
